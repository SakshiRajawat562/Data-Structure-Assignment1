# ðŸŒ¦ Weather Data Storage System

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is part of *Assignment 1 (Data Structures)*.  
It implements a *Weather Data Storage System* using *2D arrays and Abstract Data Types (ADTs)*.  

The system allows storing weather records (date, city, temperature), retrieving them, and displaying data using *row-major* and *column-major* traversal. It also supports *sparse data handling* and provides *complexity analysis* for operations.

## âœ¨ Features
- âœ… *WeatherRecord ADT* (Date, City, Temperature)  
- âœ… Insert, Delete, Retrieve operations  
- âœ… *Row-Major Access* (Year â†’ Cities)  
- âœ… *Column-Major Access* (City â†’ Years)  
- âœ… Handle *Sparse Data* efficiently  
- âœ… Display results in *tabular format*  
- âœ… *Time & Space Complexity Analysis*

Would you like me to also write a **report.md/pdf** (with problem statement, methodology, outputs, and conclusion) so you can directly attach it along with your GitHub code?
